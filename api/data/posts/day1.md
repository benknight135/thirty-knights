First leg is from Brighton to London for the Eurostar. I took a moment to marvel at the Brighton train station for a final time before I leave. I really love this city so much and I have so many lovely people around me. I’m a little scared to be leaving my safety net, but that doesn’t stop me being very excited for what is to come.
