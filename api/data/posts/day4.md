### Hammer time

The day started with bang. Building work started at the bright and early time of 8:30am. This included very loud drilling and hammering on the walls right next to my window! Good morning!

### Metz Cathedral

After an unexpectedly early start I thought I’d make the most of it and head out into Metz. First heading for the Cathedral. There are quite a few old very old churches and cathedrals in Metz but non quite come close to Metz Cathedral. This gothic building with huge quantities of stained class is absolutely stunning inside and out. Stepping inside provides breathtaking stained glass in ever direction, framed with looming archways.

### Team Red vs Team Yellow

Whilst exploring the city I kept running into a couple of small groups of 5/6 people all wearing either matching red hats or matching yellow hats. There were clearly on a treasure hunt of some kind and I believe in competing to find everything first. A fantastic way to explore a city so spent a little bit of time following them around from a distance to see what interesting places they may take me. This took me all over the Ancienne Ville through nook and cranny.

### Sheltering in an aqueduct

The weather took a turn for the worse in the afternoon with very heavy rain. To escape I find shelter near the old aqueduct that run along the east of the ancient village. The rain continued heavily for a long while, giving me good chance to listen podcast of a fan made retelling of the season 8 of game of thrones as a radio play, looking fix all the problems from the last season. It’s wonderful to listen to fantasy while surrounded with ancient architecture and beautiful green spaces.
