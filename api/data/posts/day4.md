### Hammer time

The day started with bang. Building work started at the bright and early time of 8:30am. This included very loud drilling and hammering on the walls right next to my window! Good morning!

### Metz Cathedral

After an unexpectedly early start I thought Iâ€™d make the most of it and head out into Metz. First heading for the Cathedral. There are quite a few old very old churches and cathedrals in Metz but non quite come close to Metz Cathedral. This gothic building with huge quantities of stained class is absolutely stunning inside and out. Stepping inside provides breathtaking stained glass in ever direction, framed with looming archways.
