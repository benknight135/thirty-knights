### Change of plans

This is the magic of inter railing. Being able to be wildly spontaneous. I found out last night that the beloved Myizaki animated film Howl’s Moving Castle was based on the French city of Colmar. I am just two hours from this city right now and it’s in the same direction I was going to be heading on the way to Bern where I am going next. So today I will be taking an impromptu trip to Colmar!
