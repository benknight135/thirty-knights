### Crossing boarders at speed

Today I will be travelling from Lille to Metz. This journey will take me through the border for both Brussels and Luxembourg before crossing back over into France towards Metz. All in all this will take 7 hours and 4 trains. It would have been possible to take a more direct route via Paris however this would have required an additional reservation fee and I am doing by best in this trip to avoid that where possible. Also I’d like to reserve seeing Paris till the end of my trip as that will be a signal that my trip is coming to a close. Can’t be spoiling the fun early!

I checked out of my hostel around 8:00 and walked down to the Lille Flandres station, grabbing myself a croissant on the way. Then it was a quick hop to Mouscron, followed by and hour and half across to Brussels. I sadly only get to see a very grey industrial look at Brussels but I’ve only got a 20mins change before heading to Luxembourg.

### Forests through the window

The journey from Brussels to Luxembourg is a very beautiful one, making its ways through miles and miles of thick forests near Parc naturel régional des Ardennes. The train slowly makes it’s way peacefully through the countryside. The odd town poking its way through the trees with a church steeple in the clearing of a valley.
