### To Verona

Today I am on my way to Venice, taking a day trip to Verona on the way. My feet are still saw from the long walks of the past few days so I will decide how much exploring to do in Verona once I arrive.

### Verona

After a little bit lunch and some exploring of Ponte Scaligero Ponte di Castelvecchio and the surrounding area I quickly got very exhausted. I have been doing a lot of walking over the last few days and it’s finally taking its toll. I had looked up a few places to explore around Verona but I didn’t feel much like walking to them without knowing they would be worth it. I decided to conserve my energy for Venice tomorrow and head back to the station.
